1
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:07,396
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

2
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,698
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:13,218
Greef Karga said you were
the best in the parsec.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:18,503
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting
for you upon delivery of the asset.

5
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,454
You are Mandalorian!

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,331
I will help you.

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,043
Many have passed through.

8
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,011
They seek the same one.

9
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,797
IG Unit! Stand down.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,081
You are a Guild member?

11
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:36,342
I have a suggestion. We split the reward.

12
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:37,637
This is acceptable.

13
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:42,526
The tracking fob is still active.

14
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:44,144
There is a life form present.

15
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:46,261

16
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:12,979
I thought you were dead.

17
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,085
This is what was causing all the fuss?

18
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,794
I think it's a child.

19
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,565
It is better to deliver it alive then.

20
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,925
My ship has been destroyed.
I'm trapped here.

21
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,513
Stripped. Not destroyed.

22
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:50,683
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

23
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:53,980
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

24
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,774
They're protected by
their crawling fortress.

25
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:01,402
There's no way to recover the parts.

26
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:02,945
You can trade.

27
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,489
With Jawas? Are you out of your mind?

28
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,951
I will take you to them.

29
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:08,953
I have spoken.

30
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,250
Hey! Spit that out.

31
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,854
_

32
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:10,263
They really don't like
you for some reason.

33
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:13,276
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

34
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,378
You need to drop your rifle.

35
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,909
I'm a Mandalorian.

36
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,694
Weapons are part of my religion.

37
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:27,972
Then you are not
getting your parts back.

38
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,579
Fine.

39
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:44,841
And the blaster.

40
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,803
Good day.

41
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,706
They will trade all the
parts for the beskar.

42
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

43
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:22,627
They stole them from me.

44
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,130
_

45
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,635
_

46
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:31,635
_

47
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,471
- You understand this?
- No!

48
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,226
Whoa. Easy, easy.

49
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,689
_

50
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,318
_

51
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:48,736
Get away from it!

52
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,182
_

53
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,432
_

54
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,048
The egg? What egg?

55
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,947
_

56
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:15,986
_

57
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,822
_

58
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,525
_

59
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,142
Mando!

60
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,311
I have it.

61
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:20,062
I've got the egg.

62
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,572
I'm surprised you waited.

63
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,370
I'm surprised you took so long.

64
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,140
Is it still sleeping?

65
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,186
Yes.

66
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:46,232
Was it injured?

67
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:50,361
I don't think so. Not physically.

68
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:52,861
Explain it to me again.

69
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,892
I still don't understand what happened.

70
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,621
Neither do I.

71
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:07,795
There's no way we're
gonna get this to work

72
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,196
without a full maintenance facility.

73
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,408
This is gonna take days to fix.

74
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,392
If you care to help, it might go faster.

75
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,766
There is much work to do.

76
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:31,045
I can't thank you enough.

77
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,892
Please allow me to give
you a portion of the reward.

78
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:36,007
I cannot accept.

79
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:40,231
You are my guest and I am
therefore in your service.

80
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:49,142
I could use a crew member of your
ability, and I can pay handsomely.

81
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:50,857
I am honored,

82
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:55,319
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

83
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:56,753
I understand.

84
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,115
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

85
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,992
And I offer mine.

86
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,621
Thank you for bringing
peace to my valley.

87
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:21,470
And good luck with The Child.

88
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:24,767
May it survive and bring
you a handsome reward.

89
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,687
I have spoken.
