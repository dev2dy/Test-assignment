1
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,396
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

2
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:59,698
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

3
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:03,218
Greef Karga said you were
the best in the parsec.

4
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:08,503
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting
for you upon delivery of the asset.

5
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,454
You are Mandalorian!

6
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,331
I will help you.

7
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,043
Many have passed through.

8
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:20,011
They seek the same one.

9
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,797
IG Unit! Stand down.

10
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,081
You are a Guild member?

11
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,342
I have a suggestion. We split the reward.

12
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:27,637
This is acceptable.

13
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,526
The tracking fob is still active.

14
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,144
There is a life form present.

15
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:36,261

16
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,979
I thought you were dead.

17
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,085
This is what was causing all the fuss?

18
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,794
I think it's a child.

19
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:29,565
It is better to deliver it alive then.

20
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,925
My ship has been destroyed.
I'm trapped here.

21
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,513
Stripped. Not destroyed.

22
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:40,683
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

23
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,980
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

24
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,774
They're protected by
their crawling fortress.

25
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:51,402
There's no way to recover the parts.

26
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:52,945
You can trade.

27
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,489
With Jawas? Are you out of your mind?

28
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,951
I will take you to them.

29
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,953
I have spoken.

30
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,250
Hey! Spit that out.

31
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,854
_

32
00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:00,263
They really don't like
you for some reason.

33
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:03,276
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

34
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,378
You need to drop your rifle.

35
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:13,909
I'm a Mandalorian.

36
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,694
Weapons are part of my religion.

37
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:17,972
Then you are not
getting your parts back.

38
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:22,579
Fine.

39
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,841
And the blaster.

40
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,803
Good day.

41
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:08,706
They will trade all the
parts for the beskar.

42
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,250
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

43
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:12,627
They stole them from me.

44
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,130
_

45
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:19,635
_

46
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:21,635
_

47
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,471
- You understand this?
- No!

48
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:26,226
Whoa. Easy, easy.

49
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,689
_

50
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,318
_

51
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,736
Get away from it!

52
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,182
_

53
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,432
_

54
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,048
The egg? What egg?

55
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,947
_

56
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:05,986
_

57
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,822
_

58
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,525
_

59
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,142
Mando!

60
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,311
I have it.

61
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,062
I've got the egg.

62
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,572
I'm surprised you waited.

63
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:06,370
I'm surprised you took so long.

64
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:26,140
Is it still sleeping?

65
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,186
Yes.

66
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,232
Was it injured?

67
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:40,361
I don't think so. Not physically.

68
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:42,861
Explain it to me again.

69
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:45,892
I still don't understand what happened.

70
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,621
Neither do I.

71
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,795
There's no way we're
gonna get this to work

72
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,196
without a full maintenance facility.

73
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,408
This is gonna take days to fix.

74
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:05,392
If you care to help, it might go faster.

75
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,766
There is much work to do.

76
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,045
I can't thank you enough.

77
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,892
Please allow me to give
you a portion of the reward.

78
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,007
I cannot accept.

79
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:30,231
You are my guest and I am
therefore in your service.

80
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:39,142
I could use a crew member of your
ability, and I can pay handsomely.

81
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,857
I am honored,

82
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:45,319
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

83
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:46,753
I understand.

84
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:49,115
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

85
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:50,992
And I offer mine.

86
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,621
Thank you for bringing
peace to my valley.

87
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:11,470
And good luck with The Child.

88
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:14,767
May it survive and bring
you a handsome reward.

89
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:17,687
I have spoken.
