1
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,396
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

2
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,698
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

3
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:33,218
Greef Karga said you were
the best in the parsec.

4
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:38,503
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting
for you upon delivery of the asset.

5
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,454
You are Mandalorian!

6
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,331
I will help you.

7
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,043
Many have passed through.

8
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,011
They seek the same one.

9
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,797
IG Unit! Stand down.

10
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,081
You are a Guild member?

11
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,342
I have a suggestion. We split the reward.

12
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:57,637
This is acceptable.

13
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:02,526
The tracking fob is still active.

14
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,144
There is a life form present.

15
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:06,261

... <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> ...

16
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,979
I thought you were dead.

17
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,085
This is what was causing all the fuss?

18
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,794
I think it's a child.

19
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:59,565
It is better to deliver it alive then.

20
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:02,925
My ship has been destroyed.
I'm trapped here.

21
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,513
Stripped. Not destroyed.

22
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:10,683
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

23
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,980
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

24
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:18,774
They're protected by
their crawling fortress.

25
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,402
There's no way to recover the parts.

26
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,945
You can trade.

27
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:25,489
With Jawas? Are you out of your mind?

28
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:26,951
I will take you to them.

29
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:28,953
I have spoken.

30
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,250
Hey! Spit that out.

31
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:17,854
_

32
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,263
They really don't like
you for some reason.

33
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,276
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

34
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,378
You need to drop your rifle.

35
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:43,909
I'm a Mandalorian.

36
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,694
Weapons are part of my religion.

37
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,972
Then you are not
getting your parts back.

38
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:52,579
Fine.

39
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:04,841
And the blaster.

40
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,803
Good day.

41
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,706
They will trade all the
parts for the beskar.

42
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,250
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

43
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,627
They stole them from me.

44
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,130
_

45
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,635
_

46
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,635
_

47
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,471
- You understand this?
- No!

48
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,226
Whoa. Easy, easy.

49
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:02,689
_

50
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,318
_

51
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,736
Get away from it!

52
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,182
_

53
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,432
_

54
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,048
The egg? What egg?

55
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:28,947
_

56
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:35,986
_

57
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:12,822
_

58
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:16,525
_

59
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,142
Mando!

60
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,311
I have it.

61
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,062
I've got the egg.

62
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:33,572
I'm surprised you waited.

63
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:36,370
I'm surprised you took so long.

64
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,140
Is it still sleeping?

65
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,186
Yes.

66
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,232
Was it injured?

67
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,361
I don't think so. Not physically.

68
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,861
Explain it to me again.

69
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:15,892
I still don't understand what happened.

70
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,621
Neither do I.

71
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:27,795
There's no way we're
gonna get this to work

72
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,196
without a full maintenance facility.

73
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,408
This is gonna take days to fix.

74
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:35,392
If you care to help, it might go faster.

75
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,766
There is much work to do.

76
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,045
I can't thank you enough.

77
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,892
Please allow me to give
you a portion of the reward.

78
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:56,007
I cannot accept.

79
00:34:56,018 --> 00:35:00,231
You are my guest and I am
therefore in your service.

80
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:09,142
I could use a crew member of your
ability, and I can pay handsomely.

81
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,857
I am honored,

82
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,319
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

83
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,753
I understand.

84
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,115
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

85
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,992
And I offer mine.

86
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,621
Thank you for bringing
peace to my valley.

87
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,470
And good luck with The Child.

88
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,767
May it survive and bring
you a handsome reward.

89
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,687
I have spoken.
